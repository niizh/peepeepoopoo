<!DOCTYPE html><!--you will always open your html document with this DOCTYPE declaration. this is how the browser
     knows to render your following code as html5, the current language standard. it's important to do this because without
     context, some html5-specific elements may not render.-->
<html><!--the <html> tag opens and so houses your entire html document.
    all tags in html will open with their name in the greater-than/less-than brackets and close around their content
    with the greater-than/less-than brackets, with a slash in the front. look for the closing html tag at the end of this doc!
    go right now please! -->
<head><!--the <head> of an html doc contains housekeeping information that ensures the content of the page will load correctly,
    as well as page title and favicon links. code written in the head isn't really visible as content to your site visitors.-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8"/><!--this line informs the browser we're using utf-8 character encoding, the unicode standard.
    again, this is insurance your content will load correctly.-->
    <link href="styles/louis louis.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><!--this <link> tag in the head informs the browser
    how the following html should be STYLED according to the linked css file. here, i'm leading the browser to pull
    data from the louislouis.css file located within the styles/ folder. rel: denotes the relationship between the linked pages.
    in this case, it's a STYLESHEET. type: clarifies again it's a css file, and this is mainly fallback for older servers that could
    potentially misunderstand contemporary html (which doesn't need the additonal specification) and load the page incorrectly.-->
    <title>peepee poopoo 69</title><!--finally this is your page title !! this is what will be seen on the open tab of your
    website in the browser.-->
</head><!--that takes care of housekeeping, so we close the heading tag like all html tags with a forward-slashed bracketed tag.-->
<body><!--the body of an html document contains all of its visible content: headers, paragraphs, images, video, etc.
    there can only be 1 <body> tag in an html document. -->
<h1><!--the <header> or <h1> tag is a container for introducing a page, page section, or navigational links. using headers without
    personalizing their styling in CSS will always result in the tag's content being presented in larger and bolded font by default
    than the contents of <p> (paragraph) or other unstyled classes.-->
    PEE PEE  POO POO
</h1>
    <!--it might be worth noting now that while classes like <h> will also visually style a page in a rudimentary but quick way, they are also understood
    by the browser to have navigational significance and so their information will be literally read by accessibility devices in a different tone. 
    for this reason, you wouldn't want to use <h> as a shortcut to enlargening and boldening text for simple aesthetic reasons instead of specifying so 
    in css, because the actual function of this styling would cause an accessibility aid to misinterpret the content.-->
<p><!--i always put most of my website contents in the paragraph <p> tag because it gives me a parent element to split up the areas i'll be styling
    in css by, even if it's not going to be a paragraph of text. techinically, once your <body> tag is declared, you don't need to adhere to this format.
    like the default bolded styling the header tag, the browser will always display <p> contents with a line of space before and after it.-->
    <div><!--here we begin to put into use the structure we built out for our page in our css sheet.
    the <div> tag has NO inherent meaning or style until it's been styled in css. without defining what you want <div> to do/look like in css, its contents will be
    presented as plain text, or along the guidelines of its parent element (here, <p>) if applicable. you can put whatever you want in <div> containers, 
    but it's best to reserve it as a functional element (like how we are blocking out display columns of content here), because its nonspecificity 
    means arbitrarily invoking div can make your code cluttered and difficult to maintain over time.-->
        <div class="container">
    <!--we can style html in css by element or class. when you add "class='container'" to this div tag, the browser will display the div element according
    to the attributes defined in the .container class you created in your css document. classes can be applied to multiple elements, and can override the features
    of the parent element. 
    for example: if you make the font size of class "container" smaller than the default font size of <p>, but don't indicate a change of the actual font, the container
    class will still present parent element's font, but alter the size as defined.-->

    <div class="fuck">PEEEEEEE <img class="img2" src="img/slut.jpg"> <!--we've added an image to our content! images in html are displayed by linking them to their location
